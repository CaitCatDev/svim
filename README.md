## Project Structure 
---
In development we will try to ensure that all code on the master/main branch will 
- Compile correctly without any tinkering needed 
- Should be "Fairly Stable"
- However this will not be the most up to date all the time

The Unstable branch will be used for all code development before it's been tested and pushed to the master branch.
- There is no gurantee it will compile straight away
- The code is more likely to have bugs and flaws such as memory leaks when compaired to master branch 
- But this code would be the most update commits.
